Auth flow

I'll help you develop this Realtor Service Management application. Let me outline the implementation plan and flow for the authentication part first.

Implementation Flow for Authentication:

1. **Authentication System Structure**:
   - Firebase Authentication for user management
   - Firestore Database for storing user profiles and organization data
   - Custom role-based access control (RBAC) system

2. **Authentication Flow**:
   ```
   A. Registration Flow:
   1. User enters basic info (username, email, password, confirm password)
   2. User selects role (Partner/Admin) via modal dropdown
   3. If Admin:
      - Creates new organization
      - Gets admin privileges
      - Receives organization creation confirmation
   4. If Partner:
      - Needs organization key/invitation code
      - Validates key against existing organizations
      - Joins existing organization
   5. Account creation confirmation

   B. Login Flow:
   1. User enters credentials
   2. System validates against Firebase
   3. System checks user role and organization
   4. Redirects to appropriate dashboard
   ```

3. **Database Structure**:
   ```
   Users Collection:
   - userId (Firebase Auth UID)
   - email
   - username
   - role (admin/partner)
   - organizationId
   - createdAt
   - lastLogin

   Organizations Collection:
   - organizationId
   - name
   - adminId
   - partners: [userId1, userId2, ...]
   - createdAt
   - invitationKey
   ```

4. **Security Implementation**:
   - Password hashing and encryption
   - Secure invitation key generation
   - Role-based access control
   - Session management
   - Input validation

Would you like me to start implementing this authentication system? I can begin with:
1. Setting up the necessary Firebase configuration
2. Creating the login and registration screens
3. Implementing the role selection modal
4. Setting up the organization creation logic

Let me know if you want me to proceed with the implementation or if you'd like to discuss/modify any part of this flow first.
